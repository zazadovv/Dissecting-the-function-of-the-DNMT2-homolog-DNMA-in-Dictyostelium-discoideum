Data Repository contains all source numerical data that was used for figure generation. The repository also houses primary .svl or .py code that were used for protein secondary structure analysis, or quantification of nucleus-cytoplasm area in the IF images. The repository also contains the dock output file reports for binding simulations (Protein Docking) of DNMT2 protein family members with one of the potential enzyme substrate tRNA-aspartate (1VTQ), and report for confidence in predicted model as well as the .PDB file for final bound complex (1VTQ-DnmA).
